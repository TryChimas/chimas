# implement contexts

CONTEXTS MAY BE GENERATED BASED on ENDPOINTS

## examples:

/boards/new endpoint
would become
BOARDS.NEW (lowercased)

/boards/<string:board_id>/topics/
would become
boards.topics
OR
boards.item.topics
OR
boards_item.topics

/boards/<string:board_id>/topics/<string:topic_id>
would become
BOARDS.TOPICS.ITEM
OR
BOARDS.ITEM.TOPICS.ITEM
OR
BAORDS_ITEM.TOPICS.ITEM

being _ITEM meaning we HAVE THE IF FOR THE CURRENT (specific) BOARD

## ENDPOINT CONTEXTS
DOT (.) MEANS ITEM
(list of topics)
/boards/<string:board_id>/topics/
has context METHOD:words and . for items:

GET:boards.topics
